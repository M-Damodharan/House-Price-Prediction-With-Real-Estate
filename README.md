# House-Price-Prediction-With-Real-Estate

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India, based on real estate data. The goal of the project is to build a predictive model that estimates property prices by analyzing key factors like location, area, number of bedrooms, amenities, and more The project involves multiple steps, from data collection and preprocessing to building and evaluating machine learning models. It also explores real estate trends specific to Bengaluru.

Key Features:
Predict house prices for properties in Bengaluru using various real estate features.
Handle missing data, categorical variables, and outliers.
Model training and evaluation using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Visualizations of data trends, feature importance, and model performance.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step analysis

Key Data Features:
Property location (Bengaluru-specific neighborhoods)
Area in square feet
Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and floors
Amenities like parking, garden, etc.
Age of the propert
Property type (apartment, house, etc.)
